## FEATURES

Please refer to the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) file for all features-related documentation.

## Design

The design of the application is based on the Material Design principles.
The central theme of the application is the simplicity of use. Thus, all the components are designed to be easy to use. The minimalistic approach was used to create something meaningful without moving out of focus. As this application is a multifunctional one and consists of many components, the decision to implement white spaces was made as it helps to create a more pleasant user experience. 

### Color Scheme


### Typography

The main font used in the application is Nunito Sans. The font-family was chosen due to its readability, which increases user experience.

### Imagery

- The main background image was generated with the user of the [BGJar](https://www.bgjar.com/) tool. The image was generated with the following settings:

  ![Background](documentation/design/background.svg)

To generate this particular pattern, I used Contour Line Generator with white background and #93D3FD54 as the color of the lines. 

- Images were downloaded from the [icons8](https://icons8.com/) website only for the home page. However, the original images were changed manually to match the color scheme.

- The main part is allocated to the use of icons from the [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website. The use of icons is essential for the user experience when it comes to multifunctional websites.
