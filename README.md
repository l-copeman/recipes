## Design

### Color Scheme

The chosen color scheme for the project, is a selection of deep reds and oranges. These colors were chosen because of their association with warmness, happiness and enthusiasm. The colors are also very autumnal, which is traditonally harvest time for many people. This helps build a connection between food and the content viewed on the project.

  - Was used for the body of the project
- ![Color](documentation/features/screenshots/color-2.png)
  - Was used for the recipe cards and message section
- ![Color](documentation/features/screenshots/color-3.png)
  - Was used for the header/footer and ingredients card
- ![Color](documentation/features/screenshots/color-5.png)
  - Was used for the delete modal and text field in the comment form


### Typography

The main font used in the application is Nunito Sans. The font-family was chosen due to its readability, which increases user experience.

### Imagery

The images used for the recipes were downloaded from the following sites:

- [Crepes Image link](https://pixabay.com/photos/pancakes-yummy-dessert-3926009/)
- [Vegan Katsu Image link](https://www.pexels.com/search/katsu/)
- [Cookie Image link](https://www.pexels.com/search/choc%20chip%20cookie/)
- [Vegetarian Chilli Image link](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-bowl-of-food-VAbBclifmvY)
- [Cheese Straw Image link](https://www.vecteezy.com/photo/47277296-cheese-sticks-with-herbs-on-a-white-surface)
- [Spinach and Feta Quiche Image link](https://www.pexels.com/search/quiche/)

Images were converted to `webp` format with Convertio to reduce size and therefore increase load time to improve UX.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the icons in the app.


### Wireframes

Wireframes were used to give visual views of how the pages should display the information. These were a first draft, so some stylings and colors are not represented in the finished project.
