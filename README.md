## Design

The design of the application is based on the Material Design principles.
The central theme of the application is the simplicity of use. Thus, all the components are designed to be easy to use. The minimalistic approach was used to create something meaningful without moving out of focus. As this application is a multifunctional one and consists of many components, the decision to implement white spaces was made as it helps to create a more pleasant user experience. 

### Color Scheme

The chosen color scheme for the project, is a selection of deep reds and oranges. These colors were chosen because of their association with warmness, happiness and enthusiasm. The colors are also very autumnal, which is traditonally harvest time for many people. This helps build a connection between food and the content viewed on the project.

### Imagery

The images used for the recipes were downloaded from the following sites:

- [Crepes Image link](https://pixabay.com/photos/pancakes-yummy-dessert-3926009/)
- [Vegan Katsu Image link](https://www.pexels.com/search/katsu/)
- [Cookie Image link](https://www.pexels.com/search/choc%20chip%20cookie/)

Images were converted to `webp` format with Convertio to reduce size and therefore increase load time to improve UX.
